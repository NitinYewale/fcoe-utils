                  FCoE Management Tools Installation Guide
                  ========================================

The FCoE Management Tools included in this package are

        fcoeadm - program to create, reset, destroy, and display FCoE interfaces
        fcoemon - program to monitor the events from the DCB daemon

Requirements:

        The HBAAPI library and the HBAAPI vendor library source must be build
and installed before you can build the management tools. The HBAAPI vendor
library, libhbalinux, may be downloaded from www.Open-FCoE.org. The instructions
in the package describes how to download and build the libraries.  See the man
pages for other requirements.

Build and Install The Management Tools
--------------------------------------

1) To build and install the management tools:

   cd open-fcoe/usr

   To build the tools,

       make LIBHBALINUX=<path-to-libhbalinux-source> \
            DCB_SRC=<path-to-DCB-source>
       make LIBHBALINUX=<path-to-libhbalinux-source> \
            DCB_SRC=<path-to-DCB-source> install

    For example,

        make LIBHBALINUX=/var/work/libhbalinux \
             DCB_SRC=/var/work/dcb/dcbd-0.7.31rt

   To cleanup, issue

       make clean
       make uninstall

   Notice that before issuing "make uninstall", make sure the fcoe service is not
   running.

2) The installation adds the following files to the system,

       /sbin/fcoeadm
       /sbin/fcoemon
       /usr/share/man/man8/fcoeadm.8.gz
       /usr/share/man/man8/fcoemon.8.gz
       /etc/fcoe/config
       /etc/fcoe/cfg-ethX (one file per ethX port)
       /etc/fcoe/scripts/fcoeplumb
       /etc/init.d/fcoe


	/etc/fcoe/ is the default configuration files location but this can be changed
	by updating the CONFIG_DIR variable in

	etc/initd/initd.*
	tools/fcoemon/fcoemon.c
	tools/fcoemon/fcoeplumb.sh
	tools/fcoemon/Makefile
