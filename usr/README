FCoE user-space tool
====================
1. fcoe init script
This system service script will reside in /etc/init.d/open-fcoe and will be
used to start fcoe on demand or durring boot-up. The open-fcoe init script
will check the fcoe config file /etc/fcoe/open-fcoe.conf for the interface that
will be used to create the FCoE instance. The open-fcoe.conf currently contains
just one line as:

HBA=<ifname>

e.g., put "HBA=eth1" in open-fcoe.conf will let you use interface "eth1" for
FCoE. By default, the installation will create a sample config file containing
the interface "eth0", please make sure to change it accordingly after install.

2. fcoeadm application
This is the user space fcoe administration tool. It creates and destroys
FCoE instances on a given interface name. It can also query some basic information
about the created fc_host. Currently it has limited functionality, but we expect 
to add more features in the near future.
