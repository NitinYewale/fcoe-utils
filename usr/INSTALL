                  FCoE Management Tools Installation Guide
                  ========================================

The FCoE Management Tools included in this package are

        fcoeadm - program to create, destroy, and to display FCoE interfaces

The HBAAPI library and the HBAAPI vendor library source must be build and
installed before you can build the management tools. The HBAAPI vendor
library, libhbalinux, may be downloaded from www.Open-FCoE.org. The instructions
in the package describes how to download and build the libraries.

Build and Install The Management Tools
--------------------------------------

1) To build and install the management tools:

   cd open-fcoe/usr

   To build the tools,

       make LIBHBALINUX=<path-to-libhbalinux-source>
       make LIBHBALINUX=<path-to-libhbalinux-source> install

   To cleanup, issue

       make clean
       make uninstall

2) The installation adds the following files to the system,

       /sbin/fcoeadm
       /usr/share/man/man8/fcoeadm.8.gz
       /etc/fcoe/open-fcoe.conf
       /etc/rc.d/init.d/open-fcoe

3) Running the tools require to have the libHBAAPI.so and libhbalinux.so,
   and /etc/hba.conf installed on the system. See the INSTALL instructions
   of HBAAPI Vendor Libraries.

4) If you have edited the file /etc/fcoe/open-fcoe.conf to include
   one and only one line of

       HBA=<ethX>

   where <ethX> is the ethernet interface you will use to create FCoE
   instance, you may start and stop the open-fcoe service with the
   following commands:

       # service open-fcoe start
       # service open-fcoe stop

       # service open-fcoe
       Usage: /etc/init.d/open-fcoe {start|stop|reload|restart|status}

   The fcoeadm tool requires the open-fcoe service to be started.
