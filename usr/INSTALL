                fcoeadm Management Tool Installation Guide
                ==========================================

The HBAAPI library and the HBAAPI vendor library must be installed before
you can build the tools. The HBAAPI vendor library may be downloaded from
www.Open-FCoE.org. The instructions in the package describes how to download
and build the HBAAPI library.

The default source code location of the HBAAPI vendor library is assumed
to be /usr/local/src/hbalinux. If you place the source in a different
localtion, you will need to specify HBALINUX=<library source code path> in
the make commands.

1) Instructions to build and install the tools:

   cd open-fcoe/usr/tools

   To build the tools, issue

       make

   or

       make HBALINUX=<library source code path>

   To cleanup the binaries before rebuild, issue

       make clean

   To build and install the tools, issue

       make install

   or

       make HBALINUX=<library source code path> install

   To uninstall the tools, issue

       make uninstall

2) The installation adds the following files to the system,

       /usr/local/bin/fcoeadm
       /usr/share/man/man8/fcoeadm.8.gz
       /etc/fcoe/open-fcoe.conf
       /etc/rc.d/init.d/open-fcoe

3) Running the tools require to have the libHBAAPI.so and libhbalinux.so,
   and /etc/hba.conf installed on the system. See the INSTALL instructions
   of HBAAPI Vendor Libraries.
